    *   Moves must be atomic.  ``shutil.move()`` is not atomic.
        Note that multiple threads may try to write to the cache at once,
        so atomicity is required to ensure the serving on one thread doesn't
        pick up a partially saved image from another thread.

    *   Moves must work across filesystems.  Often temp directories and the
        cache directories live on different filesystems.  ``os.rename()`` can
        throw errors if run across filesystems.

    So we try ``os.rename()``, but if we detect a cross-filesystem copy, we
    switch to ``shutil.move()`` with some wrappers to make it atomic.
